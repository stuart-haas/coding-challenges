## The Challenge

### Part 1

Group a data set by the date within each object.

Use `input-1.json` as your template.

The expected result is in `output-1.json`

## Part 2

Merge another data set by the matching object keys between `input-2.json` and the results from the first ouput.

If the key isn't present in the first output then append the data instead.

You'll need to use the same methodology from part 1 to first group the data in `input-2.json`.

The expected result is in `output-2.json`.
