# Coding Challenges

## Rules

1. Use any language you like 🤓
2. No third-party libraries (unit test libraries are allowed)
3. Once you have it working post your code in the coding-challenges Slack channel under the weekly thread
4. Have fun! 🥳

## Reccomendations

1. Be creative but you don't necessarily have to rewrite the wheel
2. Use comments to annotate your code
3. Write unit tests
